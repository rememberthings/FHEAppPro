# TrustShield

**Confidential verification system powered by Zama FHEVM**

TrustShield enables trustless verification of sensitive credentials and attestations where verification proofs are computed over encrypted data. Built on Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption Virtual Machine, the platform verifies claims, checks credentials, and validates attestations without exposing underlying data to verifiers or validators.

---

## Summary

TrustShield solves the verification-privacy paradox: proving authenticity of credentials while maintaining data confidentiality. Traditional verification systems require exposing credentials to verifiers, creating privacy risks. TrustShield uses Zama FHEVM to perform verification operations over encrypted credentials, revealing only verification results—never the credential data itself.

**Application Domain**: Digital identity verification, credential attestation, trust score computation, and privacy-preserving reputation systems.

## Verification Model

### Traditional Verification

**Current Approach:**
1. User submits credentials to verifier
2. Verifier inspects credentials (data exposed)
3. Verifier validates against reference data
4. Verification result issued
5. **Privacy Risk**: All credential data visible to verifier

### TrustShield Approach

**Privacy-Preserving Process:**
1. User encrypts credentials using FHE public key
2. Encrypted credentials submitted to smart contract
3. Verifier provides encrypted reference data
4. Smart contract performs homomorphic verification
5. Verification result computed over encrypted data
6. Result revealed (pass/fail) without credential exposure

**Privacy Benefit**: Verifiers prove authenticity without seeing credential contents.

## Verification Operations

### Credential Verification

**Encrypted Credential Structure:**
```solidity
struct EncryptedCredential {
    euint8[] encryptedData;    // Credential payload encrypted
    bytes32 dataHash;           // Integrity hash
    euint64 encryptedScore;     // Trust score (encrypted)
    uint256 issueDate;          // Public metadata
    address issuer;             // Public issuer address
}
```

**Homomorphic Verification:**
```solidity
// Compare encrypted credential with encrypted reference
ebool isValid = TFHE.eq(credential.encryptedData, reference.encryptedData);

// Check encrypted score against threshold
ebool meetsThreshold = TFHE.gt(credential.encryptedScore, threshold);

// Aggregate verification result
ebool verificationResult = TFHE.and(isValid, meetsThreshold);
```

### Attestation Verification

**Attestation Process:**
- Attester encrypts attestation claim
- Encrypted attestation stored on-chain
- Verifiers query encrypted attestations
- Verification computed homomorphically
- Results published without revealing claims

### Trust Score Computation

**Score Calculation:**
- Multiple encrypted inputs (credentials, history, references)
- Homomorphic aggregation of trust factors
- Encrypted trust score computed
- Score compared to thresholds (encrypted)
- Final result revealed

## Verification Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Educational Credential Verification

**Use Case**: Employer verifies university degree without seeing transcript details

**Process:**
1. Graduate encrypts degree information
2. University encrypts reference degree data
3. Smart contract verifies encrypted match
4. Employer receives verification result (valid/invalid)
5. Degree details never exposed to employer

**Privacy Benefit**: Employer proves degree authenticity without accessing grades or coursework details.

### Scenario 2: Professional License Verification

**Use Case**: Licensing board verifies professional credentials while maintaining privacy

**Process:**
1. Professional encrypts license information
2. Board encrypts valid license references
3. Homomorphic verification performed
4. License status verified (active/expired/suspended)
5. Personal details remain private

**Privacy Benefit**: License validity proven without exposing personal information.

### Scenario 3: Trust Score Calculation

**Use Case**: Compute trustworthiness score from multiple encrypted sources

**Process:**
1. Multiple encrypted inputs collected
2. Homomorphic aggregation performed
3. Trust score computed over encrypted values
4. Score compared to thresholds
5. Final trust level revealed

**Privacy Benefit**: Comprehensive trust assessment without exposing individual factors.

## Implementation Details

### FHE Operations

**Encryption:**
```typescript
const encryptedCredential = TFHE.encrypt(credentialData, publicKey);
```

**Verification:**
```solidity
ebool isValid = TFHE.eq(encryptedCredential, encryptedReference);
```

**Aggregation:**
```solidity
euint64 totalScore = TFHE.add(score1, score2, score3);
euint64 average = TFHE.div(totalScore, count);
```

**Comparison:**
```solidity
ebool passes = TFHE.gt(encryptedScore, encryptedThreshold);
```
